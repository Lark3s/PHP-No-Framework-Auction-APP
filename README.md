# PHP-No-Framework-Auction-APP
An acution app made in PHP, using only common libraries. It was a personal challenge to not use a framework, but take inspiration from existing ones and try to make something that works.
It got developed further for the purposes of a university class, but because of time constraints ended up becoming a bit messy and had some functionalities that did not fit the vision for the app I had, so this is an earlier version that I plan to properly develop in the future.(some stuff might be broken or leftover)
