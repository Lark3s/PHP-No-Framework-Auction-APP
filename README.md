#PHP-No-Framework-Auction-APP
An acution app made in PHP, using only common libraries. It was a personal challenge to not use a framework, but take inspiration from existing ones and try to make something that works.
It got developed further for the purposes of a university class, but because of time constraints ended up becoming a it messy, so this is an earlier version(some stuff might be broken/unfinished because of that) that I might try do develop further.
